## Java Basics

### JDK, JRE, JVM
- **JDK (Java Development Kit)**: A software development environment for Java. Think of it as a toolbox that includes JRE and development tools like the compiler (`javac`).
- **JRE (Java Runtime Environment)**: Provides the libraries and JVM needed to run compiled Java code. Imagine it as the stage where the Java "play" is performed.
- **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**: Executes Java bytecode. It's like the "actor" who performs the script on the stage.

### Public Static Void Main
- **Public Static Void Main**: The entry point for a Java application. `public` means it's accessible from anywhere, `static` means it doesn't require an object instance, and `void` means it returns nothing. Think of it as the main door to a building that anyone can enter.

### Data Types
- **Primitive Data Types**: `byte`, `short`, `int`, `long`, `float`, `double`, `char`, `boolean`. These are like the basic building blocks in a construction set.
- **Non-Primitive Data Types**: Arrays, Strings, and Objects. These are like complex structures made from basic building blocks.

---

## Data Structures

### HashMap
- **HashMap**: A data structure that stores key-value pairs. Think of it as a dictionary where you can quickly look up definitions.

### List vs Set
- **List vs Set**: List allows duplicates and maintains order. Set doesn't allow duplicates and may not maintain order. Imagine a List as a playlist where songs can repeat, and a Set as a unique album collection.

### Stack and Queue
- **Stack**: A Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure. Think of it like a stack of books where you can only add or remove books from the top.
- **Queue**: A First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure. Imagine it as a line of people waiting for a bus; the first one in line is the first one to board.

---

## Object-Oriented Programming

### Abstract Class vs Interface
- **Abstract Class vs Interface**: Abstract classes can have both abstract and concrete methods. Interfaces can only have abstract methods. Think of an abstract class as a blueprint with some pre-defined features, and an interface as a contract that a class must adhere to.

### Instance Methods vs Static Methods
- **Instance Methods vs Static Methods**: Instance methods belong to an instance of the class. Static methods belong to the class itself. Think of instance methods as personal habits that vary from person to person, and static methods as family traditions that are the same for all family members.

### Encapsulation
- **Encapsulation**: The bundling of data and methods that operate on that data. Think of it as a capsule that holds both the medicine (data) and instructions on how to use it (methods).

### Polymorphism
- **Polymorphism**: The ability of a single function to handle different data types or objects. Think of it as a universal remote control that can operate multiple devices.

### Inheritance
- **Inheritance**: The mechanism by which one class can inherit attributes and methods from another class. Think of it as a child inheriting traits from their parents.

## Java Features

### Comparable vs Comparator
- **Comparable vs Comparator**: Comparable provides a single sorting sequence. Comparator allows multiple sorting sequences. Think of Comparable as sorting books by title only, and Comparator as sorting books by title, author, or year.

### StringBuilder vs StringBuffer
- **StringBuilder vs StringBuffer**: StringBuilder is not thread-safe. StringBuffer is thread-safe. Think of StringBuilder as a notepad that only one person can write on at a time, and StringBuffer as a notepad that multiple people can write on simultaneously.

### Generics
- **Generics**: Allows you to write code that is type-safe yet reusable. Think of it as a container that can hold any type of object but knows what type it is holding.

### Annotations
- **Annotations**: Metadata that can be added to Java code. Think of them as sticky notes that you attach to your code for additional information.

## Programming Principles

### SOLID Principles
- **SOLID Principles**: A set of five design principles aimed at making software more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. Think of them as the golden rules for writing good code.

### WET vs DRY
- **WET (Write Everything Twice, Waste Everyone's Time)**: Code that is repetitive and not reusable. Think of it as manually washing dishes one by one.
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Code that is modular and reusable. Think of it as using a dishwasher to clean multiple dishes at once.

### KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
- **KISS**: A design principle that states simplicity should be a key goal in design. Think of it as using a simple recipe to cook a delicious meal.

---

## Java Testing

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: A software development approach in which tests are written before the code that needs to be tested. Think of it as sketching out a blueprint before building a house.

### Mocking
- **Mocking**: Creating mock objects that simulate the behavior of real objects in controlled ways. Think of it as using a stunt double in a movie.

---

## Algorithms and Problem-Solving

### Big O Notation
- **Big O Notation**: A notation used to describe the performance of an algorithm. Think of it as the "speed limit" for how fast an algorithm can solve a problem.

### Sorting Algorithms
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Algorithms used to arrange items in a particular order. Think of them as different methods for organizing a bookshelf.

### Searching Algorithms
- **Searching Algorithms**: Algorithms used to find a specific item in a data structure. Think of them as different strategies for finding a book in a library.

---

## Design Patterns

### Singleton Pattern
- **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point to access it. Think of it as the president of a countryâ€”there can be only one at a time.

### Factory Pattern
- **Factory Pattern**: Defines an interface for creating an object but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. Think of it as a bakery that can produce different types of bread based on the recipe given.
